# Truist Bank MAPS Assessment Framework
## Modernization, Agility, Platforms & Security Evaluation
### Data Orchestration, Observability & 90-Day Roadmap Focus

### Executive Summary

This comprehensive MAPS (Modernization, Agility, Platforms, Security) assessment framework is designed to evaluate Truist Bank's current state and maturity across critical technology domains with specific focus on data orchestration, platform observability, autonomous capabilities (AI/ML), data integrity and reliability, FinOps, and data management. The framework aligns with banking regulatory requirements including FFIEC guidelines, OCC regulations, and Federal Reserve guidance while incorporating the specific needs of Truist's operations team, platform team, and data governance initiatives. The assessment will produce a prioritized 90-day backlog and roadmap for immediate implementation.

### Framework Overview

The assessment framework consists of four primary assessment domains, each containing detailed evaluation criteria, maturity levels, and scoring methodologies. The framework is designed to provide actionable insights for technology leadership to identify gaps, prioritize investments, and track progress toward industry-leading capabilities.
