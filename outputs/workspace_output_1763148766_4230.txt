# Truist Assessment Framework - Scoring and Implementation Guide

## Scoring Methodology

### Rating Scale Details

**5-Point Maturity Scale:**
- **1.0 - Basic/Initial**: Ad-hoc processes, limited documentation, reactive approach
- **2.0 - Developing**: Some standardization, basic controls, emerging practices
- **3.0 - Established**: Defined processes, consistent execution, systematic approach
- **4.0 - Advanced**: Optimized processes, continuous improvement, best practices
- **5.0 - Leading Practice**: Industry-leading, innovative approaches, thought leadership

### Scoring Guidelines

**Score Assignment Criteria:**

**Score 1 (Basic)**
- Processes are ad-hoc and inconsistent
- Limited documentation exists
- Activities are primarily reactive
- Minimal tooling or automation
- No formal governance

**Score 2 (Developing)**
- Basic processes are documented
- Some standardization exists
- Initial governance framework
- Basic tools implemented
- Reactive with some proactive elements

**Score 3 (Established)**
- Comprehensive processes documented
- Consistent execution across teams
- Formal governance structure
- Standardized tools and methods
- Balanced proactive/reactive approach

**Score 4 (Advanced)**
- Optimized and efficient processes
- Continuous improvement culture
- Advanced tooling and automation
- Predictive capabilities
- Industry best practices adopted

**Score 5 (Leading)**
- Industry-leading practices
- Innovation and thought leadership
- Autonomous operations where applicable
- External influence and sharing
- Continuous innovation

### Weighting Framework

**Domain Weights for Overall Assessment:**
- **SRE (25%)**: Critical for operational stability and customer experience
- **Automation (25%)**: Essential for efficiency, cost reduction, and risk mitigation
- **AI (25%)**: Strategic differentiator and competitive advantage
- **Audit (25%)**: Regulatory requirement and risk management foundation

**Calculation Formula:**
```
Overall Score = (SRE Score × 0.25) + (Automation Score × 0.25) + (AI Score × 0.25) + (Audit Score × 0.25)
```
