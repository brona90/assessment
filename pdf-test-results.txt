1) Scenario: PDF includes detailed results # features/pdf_export.feature:24
   ✔ Before # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/setup.js:16
   ✔ Given I have completed an assessment # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/assessment_steps.js:4
   ✔ And I have answers for all questions # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/assessment_steps.js:63
   ✔ And my scores are calculated # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/assessment_steps.js:38
   ✔ When I generate a PDF # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/pdf_export_steps.js:27
   ✔ Then the PDF should include detailed assessment results # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/pdf_export_steps.js:86
   ✔ And it should show all questions and answers # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/pdf_export_steps.js:92
   ✖ And it should organize results by domain # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/pdf_export_steps.js:102
