Failures:

1) Scenario: Complete assessment with all domains # features/assessment_workflow.feature:26
   ✔ Before # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/setup.js:16
   ✔ Given I am on the technology assessment page # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/setup.js:20
   ✔ And the assessment data is loaded # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/setup.js:41
   ✔ When I answer all questions across all domains # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/assessment_steps.js:122
   ✔ Then I should see a completion message # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/assessment_steps.js:257
   ✖ And the overall score should be calculated # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/assessment_steps.js:265
       Error: expect(locator).toBeVisible() failed

       Locator: locator('text=/\\d+\\.\\d+/').first()
       Expected: visible
       Timeout: 5000ms
       Error: element(s) not found

       Call log:
         - Expect "to.be.visible" with timeout 5000ms
         - waiting for locator('text=/\\d+\\.\\d+/').first()

           at World.<anonymous> (file:///workspace/features/step_definitions/assessment_steps.js:274:38)
   - And domain scores should be displayed # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/assessment_steps.js:289
   ✔ After # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/setup.js:52

2) Scenario: Reset assessment # features/assessment_workflow.feature:39
   ✔ Before # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/setup.js:16
   ✔ Given I am on the technology assessment page # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/setup.js:20
   ✔ And the assessment data is loaded # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/setup.js:41
   ✔ When I have answered questions # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/assessment_steps.js:52
   ✔ And I reset the assessment # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/assessment_steps.js:188
   ✔ Then all answers should be cleared # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/assessment_steps.js:311
   ✖ And progress should be reset to 0 # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/assessment_steps.js:319
       Error: expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

       Expected: true
       Received: false

3) Scenario: Hide compliance when no frameworks enabled # features/compliance_frameworks.feature:34
   ✔ Before # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/setup.js:16
   ✔ Given I am on the compliance section # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/compliance_steps.js:4
   ✔ And compliance data is loaded # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/compliance_steps.js:23
   ✔ When all frameworks are disabled # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/compliance_steps.js:62
   ✔ Then the compliance tab should be hidden # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/compliance_steps.js:168
   ✖ And the main navigation should update # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/compliance_steps.js:179
       Error: expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

       Expected: true
       Received: false
           at Proxy.<anonymous> (/workspace/node_modules/playwright/lib/matchers/expect.js:221:24)
           at World.<anonymous> (file:///workspace/features/step_definitions/compliance_steps.js:184:21)
   - And the layout should adjust accordingly # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/compliance_steps.js:187
   ✔ After # file:/workspace/features/step_definitions/setup.js:52
