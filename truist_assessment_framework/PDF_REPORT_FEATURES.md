Domain Score = Average of all answered questions in domain
Overall Score = (D1 × 30%) + (D2 × 25%) + (D3 × 25%) + (D4 × 20%)
Gap = Target Score (4.0) - Current Score
Completion = (Answered Questions / Total Questions) × 100%
```

- **4.1 - 5.0**: Industry Leading - Best-in-class capabilities
- **3.1 - 4.0**: Meeting Standards - Good progress, on track
- **2.1 - 3.0**: Below Average - Significant improvement needed
- **0.0 - 2.0**: Critical Gaps - Immediate action required

### Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Gap > 1.5 or Score < 2.0
