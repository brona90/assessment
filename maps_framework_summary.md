# Truist MAPS Assessment Framework - Executive Summary
## Modernization, Agility, Platforms & Security Evaluation

### Framework Overview

The Truist MAPS (Modernization, Agility, Platforms, Security) Assessment Framework provides a comprehensive evaluation methodology specifically designed for Truist's internal MAPS initiative. This framework focuses on the key areas identified by Truist's operations and platform teams: data orchestration and observability, platform observability, autonomous capabilities (AI/ML), data integrity and reliability, FinOps, and data management.

### Assessment Architecture - MAPS Aligned

**Four Domain Structure:**

**1. Data Orchestration & Platform Observability - 30% Weight**
- Data pipeline automation and workflow orchestration
- Platform monitoring, alerting, and distributed tracing
- Data movement, integration, and integrity tracking
- Real-time observability and performance insights

**2. FinOps & Data Management - 25% Weight**
- Cloud cost management and financial governance
- Data lifecycle management and governance frameworks
- Data quality monitoring and controls (DQ/DG)
- Data architecture modernization and platform optimization

**3. Autonomous Capabilities (AI/ML) - 25% Weight**
- Self-healing systems and predictive maintenance
- AI/ML platform development and MLOps implementation
- Intelligent alerting and automated root cause analysis
- Model risk management and performance monitoring

**4. Operations & Platform Team Alignment - 20% Weight**
- Cross-team collaboration and shared tooling
- Integrated workflows and common platforms
- Operational excellence and MAPS initiative alignment
- Unified operations and joint incident response

- Cost visibility dashboard deployment
- Team communication protocol establishment

**Sprint 2 (Days 31-60): Core Capabilities**
- Automated health checks and monitoring
- Data quality rules implementation
- Intelligent alerting pilot programs
- Cross-team collaboration enhancement

**Sprint 3 (Days 61-90): Optimization & Intelligence**
- Predictive monitoring capabilities
- Advanced cost analytics implementation
- Self-healing systems deployment
- Unified operations center establishment

### Tool Discovery & Assessment Process

**Unknown Tool Identification:**
Since the full list of tools is not known, the framework includes:
- Collaborative tool inventory workshops with operations/platform teams
- Shadow IT discovery sessions
- Integration point mapping
- Tool capability assessment against MAPS objectives

**Tool Categories for Assessment:**
- Monitoring & Observability (APM, infrastructure, logs, tracing)
- Data Orchestration (ETL/ELT, workflow management, data integration)
- FinOps & Cost Management (cloud cost, resource optimization, billing)
- AI/ML Platforms (model serving, feature stores, MLOps)
- Collaboration & Documentation (team communication, knowledge sharing)

### Regulatory Compliance Integration

**Banking Regulatory Alignment:**
- FFIEC IT Examination Handbook compliance
- OCC guidance on operational risk management
- Federal Reserve cybersecurity expectations
- Model risk management (OCC Bulletin 2011-12)
- Data governance and privacy requirements

**MAPS-Specific Compliance:**
- Operational resilience and business continuity
- Third-party risk management for cloud services
- Data integrity and reliability standards
- Financial risk management integration
